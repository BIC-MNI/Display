The following is all optional, Display will run without it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Display can read the menu definition file at runtime, and searches for it
in the following places, taking the first one it finds:

                              Display.menu

   1) current directory
   2) runtime directory: environment variable DISPLAY_DIRECTORY, or, if not
                         set, directory implied by command executed
                            (i.e. ../bin/Display will look in ../bin)
   3) user's home directory
   4) /usr/local/mni/lib
   5) /usr/local/lib       - this is where you should put it.

An optional file, which sets the values of certain variables, is also searched
for.  You do not need to install this anywhere, unless you want to override
the program defaults:

                              Display.globals

    All of the following occurrences of Display.globals are read, if they exist,
with the later assignments of variables overwriting earlier ones:

   1) /usr/local/lib      - this is where defaults for all users go
   2) /usr/local/mni/lib
   3) runtime directory: environment variable DISPLAY_DIRECTORY, or, if not
                         set, directory implied by command executed
                            (i.e. ../bin/Display will look in ../bin)
   4) user's home directory
   5) current directory
