\section{Configuration variables}
\label{secGlobals}

\display{} includes many ``global variables'' that can be set in a
configuration file, from the command line, or using a command within
the program.  These globals serve a wide range of
purposes - they may control the appearance of the user interface, set
parameters for surface extraction, control editing behavior, or even
affect low-level graphics performance. Many of the globals are not
intended to be changed during program execution, as their values may
only be read at startup. Others can be changed dynamically while the
program is running, and may take effect immediately. Some globals are
set implicitly by specific commands in the \display{} user interface.

Most of these globals have not been rigorously tested over their
entire possible range. Input checking is often minimal. It is
therefore possible to alter the behavior of the program in unexpected
or confusing ways. This document will not be comprehensive, but will
attempt to explain some of the most useful variables.

Every global variable has a name and a type, and the program will only
accept values it recognizes as being in the proper type. 

Variable names typically start with an initial capital letter and
consist of several descriptive words separated by underscores. In all
contexts, \display{} requires that the name be given exactly as
specified, with the correct capitalization.

Variable types may be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item String - Any string of ASCII characters.
\item Boolean - A string representing a boolean (true or false) value. Only the first character of the string is examined, with a 't' or `T' indicating true and an 'f' or 'F' indicating false.
\item Integer - A whole decimal number.
\item Real - A decimal number with an optional fractional part.
\item Point - A set of three floating-point number
s specifying a position
along the X,Y, and Z axes.
\item Vector - A set of three floating-point numbers specifying a direction
along the X,Y, and Z axes.
\item Colour - Either a string that gives a colour name (e.g. ``BLUE'') or a series of 3 or 4 numbers specifying RGB or RGBA values in the range 0-1.
\item Surface property - A set of five floating-point parameters that give
the surface properties of an object.
\end{itemize}

Certain types, especially String or Integer, may have other
interpretations depending on the specific variable. For example, some
strings may be interpreted as filenames or formatting strings.

\subsection{Setting globals in a configuration file}
The most reliable way to set global variables is through the configuration file, which is loaded very early in the initialization process. Many of the configuration values are used only during program initialization, so setting them from the command line or the internal command may have no effect!

By default, the configuration file is named {\tt Display.globals}, and
it is most commonly located in the user's home directory. However, the 
program searches for the file in each of the following locations, in order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item /usr/local/lib/
\item The hard-coded installation directory for the package.
\item The directory that contains the binary image for \display.
\item The user's home directory.
\item The current directory ('.').
\end{enumerate}

Note that if a file named {\tt Display.globals} is present in any of these
directories, each such file will be loaded. Therefore it is possible
for later configuration files to add or replace values set in
previously loaded configuration files.

We have recently added a separate configuration file named {\tt
 .mni-displayrc} which is identical in syntax to {\tt
 Display.globals}, but which is intended only for internal use by the
program. It may be overwritten by certain commands in the user interface.

A configuration file consists of a series of lines consisting of a
variable name, followed by one or more spaces, an equals sign ('='),
and finally a variable value. Each line is terminated with a semicolon
(';'). Comments may be included by using a hash ('\#') as the first character
on a line. Comments and empty lines are ignored.

Here is an example {\tt Display.globals} file:
\begin{verbatim}
# Here is a comment.
Default_marker_label = Hippocampus;
#Default_marker_size = 0.02;
Hide_3D_window = false;
Hide_marker_window = false;
Atlas_filename = /data1/users/bert/talairach/Talairach_atlas.list
Max_polygon_scan_distance=0.5;
Object_outline_enabled = True;
Convert_volumes_to_byte=False;
Slice_readout_text_font = 0;
Display_frame_info = True;
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Setting globals on the command line}

A global can be set from the command line by specifying the {\tt
 -global} command line option. The command line is parsed after the
configuration files are loaded, so values specified on the command
line may override the setting in the configuration files. This will
not be true for all globals, as many of them are only used during the
earliest part of program initialization.

The command line option takes a variable name and value separated from
the option by spaces:
\begin{verbatim}
Display -global Default_paint_label 5 my_t1_image.mnc
\end{verbatim}
This example will set the initial value used for voxel labeling (``painting'') to 5 instead of the default, which is 1.

You can repeat the {\tt -global} option as many times as you like, to
set any number of globals.

\subsection{Setting globals with a menu command}

The \menutwo{Quit}{Global Var} menu command allows you to inspect or
change the value of any global variable. In the default menu structure,
this command is accessed from the ``Quit'' sub-menu, so one can invoke
the command by pressing the '7' key followed by the 'A' key. This will
prompt you to enter a string. If you simply want to check the value of a
variable, you may just enter the variable's name and press Enter. If you
want to change the variable's value, you enter the variable's name
followed by an equals sign ('=') and the desired new value.

Again, be warned that, as with the command line, changing some globals
through this menu command will have no effect. Not all globals will take 
effect after \display{} has been initialized.

from the command line, and it has no effect if changed from the menu

background colour can be changed through a menu command, the command will not
change the colour for the menu or object windows.}{}

\globalentry{Initial\_coding\_range\_absolute}{Boolean}{False}{If true,

0-3 to contribute to the percentiles used to calculate the range.}{}

\globalentry{Initial\_label\_colour\_table} {Integer}{0}

the MNI. A value of 2 selects an experimental colour table that
attempts to maximize the visual distance between colours.}{}

 This is still quite experimental and may produce unexpected results.}{}

\globalentry{Undo\_enabled}
{Boolean}{True}
{Determines whether or not the ``undo'' option is {\em ever} enabled when painting the slice window.

\globalentry{Update\_3d\_view\_on\_load}
{Boolean}{True}
{
If TRUE, the 3D view zoom level and position be updated when a new
graphics file is loaded. The advantage of enabling this option is that

\globalentry{Min\_interval\_between\_updates}{Real}{0.02}
{Sets the number of seconds between timer events. Each timer event may
