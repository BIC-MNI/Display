Displaying an oblique slice in MNI Display
------------------------------------------

Robert Vincent (robert.d.vincent@mcgill.ca)

The fourth (lower right) panel in Display's "slice window" is normally
blank. However, it is possible to use this panel to view a slice cut
through an arbitrary oblique plane through the volume. Since I had no
idea that this was possible, I decided it might be useful to write
down some basic instructions.

1. First, run Display normally and load a volume.

2. From the top level menu, select the "Slice Menu" (keyboard shortcut
'S').

3. Select 'D' or "Toggle Slice Crs-S" to display the slice cross
section. This is optional, but it will display a green line that shows
the intersection of the oblique plane with the current slices.

4. Use the 'E' or "Pick Slice Angle" command to adjust this plane to
the desired orientation.

5. Select the 'R' or "Visible: 1" command to display the oblique
slice.

6. Note that there appears to be a bug which sometimes causes the
oblique slice to display only partially. If this occurs, you can use
Ctrl-Left Mouse to drag the slice back to the centre. You can also use
the usual slice window commands (e.g. Ctrl-Middle Mouse to zoom).

7. Once the oblique slice is displayed, you can use the 'E' command to
change the slice angle relative to any of the three orthogonal slices,
and you can drag the cursor in the slice window to change the location
of the oblique slice.
