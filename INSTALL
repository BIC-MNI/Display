----------------------------------------------------------------------
The MNI-Display software is using CMake to build the binary from
sources. You can compile MNI-Display like any CMake project, ie:

1 - go to the root directory of extracted sources
2 - cmake .
3 - make & make install

Alternatively, you might want to customize the compilation or the
installation. There are 3 variables you will be interested in:

cmake . \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/search/dependencies \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install

where:

- CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH is the prefix to the install path, i.e. if CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local then Display will be installed in /usr/local/bin
- CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is the prefix to the dependencies path, e.g. you might want to set it if you're installing minc and bicpl in a unsual directory.
- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release turn on the the optimizations to speed up MNI-Display.
