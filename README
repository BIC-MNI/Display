MNI-Display is an interactive program to display and segment 3 dimensional
images, as well as to display and manipulate 3D geometric objects.

The following libraries must be installed before building Display:

  NetCDF and MINC 
    - available at ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/minc/

  bicpl
    - available at ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/register+Display/

  OpenGL or Mesa
    - OpenGL may be included with your OS, or see http://www.opengl.org/
    - Mesa is a replacement for OpenGL, often included in linux distributions
      if not, see http://www.mesa3d.org/ 
      (there is also a copy of Mesa on our ftp site
       ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/register+Display/MesaLib-3.4.tar.gz)

  GLUT
    - a layer on top of OpenGL, may be included in your OS distribution
    - if not, see http://reality.sgi.com/mjk/glut3/glut3.html


See README.CVS, if you just checked-out the sources from CVS.
