MNI-Display is an interactive program to display and segment 3 dimensional
images, as well as to display and manipulate 3D geometric objects.

The following libraries must be installed before building Display.
Some of the following (typically netcdf, opengl, and glut) are
available from your OS vendor.  If possible, install the vendor
version; otherwise see the websites listed below.  Make sure you
choose the "-dev" or "-devel" binary package to ensure you have the
developer files associated with the library.


  NetCDF
    - available from http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/

  MINC and bicpl
    - available from http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/distribution/

  OpenGL or Mesa
    - OpenGL may be included with your OS, or see http://www.opengl.org/
    - Mesa is a replacement for OpenGL, often included in linux distributions
      if not, see http://www.mesa3d.org/ 
      (there is also a copy of Mesa on our ftp site
       ftp://ftp.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/pub/register+Display/MesaLib-3.4.tar.gz)

  GLUT
    - a layer on top of OpenGL
    - available from http://www.opengl.org/developers/documentation/glut


See README.CVS, if you just checked-out the sources from CVS.
