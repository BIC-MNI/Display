/* FIXME: The handling of desired_object_type seems fragile.  Can you reliably
 * cast an integer to an enum and back ?
 *
 * In pick_point_under_mouse(), one wants to specify "intersect with any object 
 * type".  An out-of-band value of -1 is used, coerced into a variable
 * of type Object_types.  Smart compilers know that the enum type "Object_types"
 * are all non-negative, so the code "if (desired_object_type < 0)" was
 * changed to cast it into an int.
